# TanksGame
Project of first programming course at the bachelor degree

The game consists of two tanks which can choose the angle and power they will use each round to hit the other base. There are also wind and possible movement of the enemy.

The project has Object-oriented desgin but all implementation is inside only one file (I was too young then. It's not my current style of coding.)
